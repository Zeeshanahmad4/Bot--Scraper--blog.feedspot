I started this blog to help heal myself and I am pretty much there. I don't take the advice of doctors and people who knew of someone else who applied some cream that magically made their symptoms disappear. I have taken a more holistic approach of healing because I don't want the quick temporary fix. I wanted a long term solution that healed me and that takes work!
